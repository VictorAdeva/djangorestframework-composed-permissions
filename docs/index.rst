djangorestframework-composed-permissions
========================================

A simple way to define complex permissions for django-rest-framework.


Introduction
------------

django-rest-framework by default has large ways to define permissions but none of them
permits define a complex, multi depth and with logical operators permissions rules.

djangorestframework-composed-permissions is full compatible with a django-rest-framework
permissions api but implements a simple way to build permission objects using reusable
components (called permission components).

djangorestframework-composed-permissions has 3 type of classes:

- Permission components: a basic unit of permission.
- Permission set: a collection of components joined with logic operator (and, or & not)
- Composed permissions: container of both, components and sets having same interface
  as django-rest-framework default permission.


How to install?
---------------

It is very simple, install it on your virtualenv with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install djangorestframework-composed-permissions


Quickstart
----------

The best way to understand how djangorestframework-composed-permissions works, is
looking some examples.

This package comes with some generic permission components defined for you, later
we will see how to define a own component but for the first example we go to use
one generic.

We go to define one permission and viewset that uses it:

.. code-block:: python

    from restfw_composed_permissions.base import (BaseComposedPermision, And, Or)
    from restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components import (
            AllowAll, AllowOnlyAuthenticated, AllowOnlySafeHttpMethod)


    class UserPermission(BaseComposedPermision):
        def global_permission_set(self):
            return Or(AllowOnlyAuthenticated,
                      And(AllowAll, AllowOnlySafeHttpMethod))

        def object_permission_set(self):
            return AllowAll


    class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        """
        A viewset for viewing and editing user instances.
        """
        permission_classes = (UserPermission,)

        serializer_class = UserSerializer
        queryset = User.objects.all()


.. note::

    `And` & `Or` classes are permission sets, that groups some components with logical
    operator. Also exists `Not` but we don't use it on this example.

`global_permission_set` method must return a permission set or only one component, and it
is evaluted on every request, however `object_permission_set` is only evaluted when
a create, update, delete operation is executed.

With `UserPermission` defined on previous example, we allow any authenticated user
for do any thing and allow anonymous requests only if request method is safe.

Low level api reference
-----------------------

This is a low level api documentation for 3 main components of this package.


Permission Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.base.BasePermissionComponent

    .. py:method:: has_permission(self, permission, request, view)

        This method must be defined always, because it is used
        on global permission evaluation process and it is executed
        always on every request.

        If you not implement this method, it will raise NotImplementedError
        exception.

        :rtype: bool

    .. py:method:: has_object_permission(self, permission, request, view, obj)

        This method must be defined if this component will be used for object
        permission checking.

        By default, returns same thing as :py:ref:`has_permission`.

        :rtype: bool

You can see `restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components` for more examples
of how define own permission components.


Permission Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Permissions sets implement same interface as components. Permission sets groups
N number of components with logical operator, with exception of `Not` that has
special behavior and it accepts only one component as parameter.

`And`, `Or` & `Not` are the default permission sets defined on this package.

The usage of `And` example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Simple usage as class instance
    class SomePermission1(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: And(Component1, Component2))

    # Using & operator of components
    class SomePermission2(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: Component1() & Component2())


The usage of `Or` examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # Simple usage as class instance
    class SomePermission1(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: Or(Component1(some_param), Component2))

    # Using | operator of components
    class SomePermission2(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: Component1() | Component2())

    # Returning a list of components
    class SomePermission3(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: [Component1, Component2])


Finally, `Not` usage examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # Simple usage as class instance
    class SomePermission1(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: Not(Component1))

    # Using ~ operator of components
    class SomePermission2(BaseComposedPermision):
        global_permission_set = (lambda s: ~Component1())


Composed Permission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a toplevel class of 3 main components of this package.

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.base.BaseComposedPermision

    Any subclass of this must define `global_permission_set` as mandatory
    method and optionally `object_permission_set` method.

    These methods must return a :py:class:`~restfw_composed_permissions.base.BasePermissionComponent` subclass
    or :py:class:`~restfw_composed_permissions.base.BasePermissionSet` subclass.


Generics
--------

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components.AllowAll

    Always allow all requests without any constraints.

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components.AllowOnlyAnonymous

    Only allow anonymous requests.

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components.AllowOnlyAuthenticated

    Only allow authenticated requests.

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components.AllowOnlySafeHttpMethod

    Only allow safe http methods.

.. py:class:: restfw_composed_permissions.generic.components.ObjectAttrEqualToObjectAttr

    This is a object level permision component and if is used on
    global permission context it always returns True.

    This component checks the equality of two expressions that are
    evaluted in "safe" way. On the context of eval are exposed "obj"
    as current object and "request" as the current request.

    This component works well for check a object owner os similary.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        class SomePermission(BaseComposedPermision):
            global_permission_set = (lambda self: AllowAll)
            object_permission_set = (lambda self:
                                        ObjectAttrEqualToObjectAttr("request.user", "obj.owner"))
